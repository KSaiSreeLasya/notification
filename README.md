**## ðŸŒŸ Overview**

This is a **Notification & Alerting Platform** that lets admins craft, manage, and send time-critical alerts across an organization, while users can receive, snooze, and track them. The app has two main views:

- **Admin interface**: Create alerts, manage users, set visibility, severity, status, etc.
- **End-User interface**: View alerts visible to the user, take actions (acknowledge, snooze, dismiss).

Itâ€™s built using Vite + React (frontend), and Supabase (backend / persistence).

**## ðŸ§© Features**

- Seed a test alert via API endpoint (`/api/seed-test-alert`)  
- Fetch visible alerts via API (`/api/visible-alerts`)  
- Filter by severity  
- Visibility / status toggles  
- Notifications, snooze, etc.  
- Role separation: Admin vs End User  
- Supabase integration for data persistence
